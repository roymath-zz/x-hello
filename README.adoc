=== Driver/Trips Coding Assignment

==== Initial Thoughts and assessment

* Problem is reasonably simple, but well designed
* Intent is to capture skill level and programmer maturity
* Use a TDD approach after first getting a skeletal version up.

==== Requirements
Here is a condensation of the requirements

 * Accept input via stdin, OR
 * Accept input via a named file
 * Verify that each line in the input file contains a valid command (Driver/Trip)
 * Commands contain space-delimited fields
 * Drivers never drive past midnight (start time<end time)
 * Discard any trips that average a speed of less than 5 mph or greater than 100 mph.
 * Generate a report containing
   ** driver
   ** total miles driven
   ** average speed

==== Design

 * Use a compiled regexp parser (for efficiency).
 * Handle Exception cases
 * Processing should succeed even if some Driver lines are listed out of order (i.e after Trips)
 * Follow rounding rules as indicated. Do not round per trip, but only in the final total.

==== Implementation
 * Use python `dateutil` for flexible date/time parsing
 * Create `__str__` method for Trip for easier debugging/diagnostics
 * use python `argparse` library for flexible command line processing and _Usage help_

==== Testing and TDD
 * Use pytest for robust testing setup.
 * Wrote tests for both positive and negative cases in BDD style
 ** test trip constructor
 ** test invalid trip by speed
 ** test driver constructor
 ** test driver with trips
 ** test all trips
 ** test all trips missing driver name
 ** test invalid trips by speed
 ** test all trips invalid trip data

==== Running the program

[source,shell]
----
tar zcvf ./rootco-coding-exercise.tgz
cd rootco-coding-exercise/

# may need to do: `pip install pytest'
python -m pytest test_driver.py

# run program (with filename)
python main.py sampledata.txt

# run program (from stdin)
cat sampledata.txt | python main.py
----

==== Notes
* I had the wrong calculation around the avg speed at first, so the expected values were helpful and I caught errors when tests broke.

==== Future Considerations
* Generate code coverage report
* Could handle the case if the driver names needed to be case insensitive.
* Didn't want to be too pedantic about documenting functions; would follow PEP257 and use `pydoc` in practice.
* If a driver row happens twice, issue a warning
